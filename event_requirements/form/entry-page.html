<h3>Questions to Identify Event Requirements</h3>

<p>MarCom’s events and registration standards promote and support events at the Museum, around the country, and around the world.</p>

<p>We make sure that anyone who wants to register, attend, and engage with Museum events and related content have exactly what is needed for the optimal sign up and an onsite attendee experience.</p>

<p>We also ensure that all registration and event data is accessible and captured for promotional, onsite, and historical reference.</p>

<p>Requirements, features, and processes are detailed below for the internal USHMM reference.</p>

<p>The below questions highlight the first batch of key details MarCom needs to build, promote, and manage registration throughout the event lifecycle.</p>

<p>Consider the following:</p>

<p>• What kind of event would you like to promote?<br />
• Is this virtual? Is this in person? Is it both?<br />
• Is the event private or public?<br />
• Is the event free or is there a fee required?<br />
• Do you want to post the event to the USHMM events calendar?<br />
